              <li>The first true piggy banks were orange-colored clay jars that had a slot in the top for depositing coins. These jars were made out of an economical material called pygg, and were shaped in round forms that resemble that of a pig.</li>

              <li>After Eldridge Cleaver took over as Black Panther Minister of Information in mid-1967, the newspaper began to print images specifically intended to incite controversy. Huey P. Newton said “[they] thought up new terms for them. At first I figured that the reverse of god—dog—would be a good epithet, but it did not catch on. [They] tried beast, brute, and animal, but none of them captured the essential quality [they] were trying to convey… Eldridge showed us a postcard from Beverly Axelrod. On the front was the slogan “Support Your Local Police”; there was a sheriff’s star above the phrase, and in the center of the star a grinning, slobbering pig. It was just what [they] were looking for. [They] began to show policemen as pigs in our cartoons, and from time to time used the word. ‘Pig’ caught on and it entered the language.”</li>

Yippies were known for using dramatic theatrics in their demonstrations, and they used Pigasus as a way to mock the social status quo. When police disrupted their demonstration, they started to call the police pigs.</li>

              <li>“Pigs (Three Different Ones)” is a song from Pink Floyd’s 1977 album Animals. In the album’s three parts, “Dogs”, “Pigs” and “Sheep”, pigs represent the people whom Roger Waters considers to be at the top of the social ladder, the ones with wealth and power. He said that pigs manipulate the rest of society and encourage them to be viciously competitive and cutthroat, so that  pigs can remain powerful.</li>

The helium-filled balloon was supposed to remain hovering over Battersea Power Station, but broke free due to a strong gust of wind. It gained a lot of media attention.</li>
